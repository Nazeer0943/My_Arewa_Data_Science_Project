# My_Arewa_Data_Science_Project
This repo is being created for the purpose of my end of Python Pragramming Fellowship project, which serves as a requirement for the successful completion of the program
Out of the thee types of projects given to us and to select one or attemt the both, I have selected the first one wich is ***"Generating Data"***, random numbers have been generated, organized, and these libraries _matplotlib_, _seaborn_ and _pandas_ have been used while visualizing  a simple barchart using the generated data.
